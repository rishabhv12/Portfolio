# Portfolio

Deploy link - https://rishabhverma.netlify.app/

# A portfolio using HTML5, CSS3 & JavaScript!

- Simplicity
- Pure CSS 
- Fully Functional
- Email service for contact/feedback
- Smooth, easy and better UX
- Mobile support (Android as well as IOS)
- Custom navbar for mobile devices (Hamburger menu)

For the email service I have used EmailJs as it can send Email Directly From JavaScript and there's no need for a server.
